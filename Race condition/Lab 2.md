This lab is for take a look about how to use turbo repeater in race conditions.
When you try to log and when you try a couple of time you get lock out. So we need to use this tool in order to perform an attack.

We need to select the attack type using the drop down menu. This time I used "race single packet attack"

Then we only need to add the passwords that we're going to use. And ,very important, %s on the parameter that we want to change in each interaction.
