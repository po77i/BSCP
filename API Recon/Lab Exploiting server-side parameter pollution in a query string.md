In this lab when we are trying to reset administrator's pass, we are able to manipulate the parameters which are being sent to the server

If we add & nothing happen. But, if we encode & (%26), we receive an error, that the field is not valid, in this case we can send this to the intruder and start to brute force wich field is valid

The variable "field" return other error, "invalid field" so in this point we have found the valid field, when you check a js file that we had found in the proxy history, in this js there is an field call reset_token, which is sending in order to reset the pass

Finally, you should add "?reset_token=token" and you will receive a web that allow to change the admin's pass
