On this lab we exploiting the that we can get some info on the comment. The idea is put more space and the comment last, in order that the victim post some headers and information, as for example his session cookie. The hardest part it is know how many space we need, the best way is maybe count how many characters is send when we send a normal post request, counting all the headers.

Here is aprox 950 to get the right information or necessary.

```

csrf=PcI6k0WAz5lgCpy5IFPHqOyCAv53W3kO&postId=5&name=Carlos+Montoya&email=carlos%40normal-user.net&website=&comment=test

```

Finally we are able to see the post, and to finish this lab we need to change our cookies for the victim's one
