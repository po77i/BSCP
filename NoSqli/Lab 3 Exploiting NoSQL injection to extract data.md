When we inject to next string, we will not receive an error, we'll get the user data. In this way we notice that the payload is working

Next, we need to try to discover the password length.

Iterating we get that 8 is the length. Because we will not get an error after 8.

Finally, we modify the payload to get the password. Iterating from 0 to 7 and letter by letter ('cause we had got a hint that is only lowercase)
