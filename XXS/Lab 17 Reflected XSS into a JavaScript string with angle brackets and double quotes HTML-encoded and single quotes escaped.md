For this lab there is a security measured implemented, which deal with quotes ('). However, we can scape to this with the same method that they use to scape from the quote, and its using a backslash (\). 
We need to use minus(-) because if we use plus (+) this is going to be encode to url.

One thing more is that we need to scape the last quote using doble slash to comment the rest of the line.
