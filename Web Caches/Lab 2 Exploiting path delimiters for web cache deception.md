Now we need to investigate path delimiter discrepancies. So we try with both, but only " ; " give to us a response, where we are able to observe that if we send to time the request, we will see that it was cached. That indicates that the cache doesn't use " ; " as a path delimiter and has a cache rule based on the .js static extension.
