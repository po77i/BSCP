In order to solve this lab we need to find a miss configuration on how the cache works. On the path ../resources/something you will find that if you send a request with this prefix the server will cache the response.

Below we can see other request with the same prefix. And again we got a hit on the cache.

Last step, we confirmed that we also can cache the request of my-account, which serve to us with our API key (the lab's solution code).

Create a script to send to us victim (Carlos).

And finally we need to request the pre-cached request with Carlos' API key
