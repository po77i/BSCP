With this lab I have a couple of problems. But, I need to take care two things
First, use the X-Forwarded-For header, and add a incremental variable to avoid the IP-based brute-force protection. And one youtuber said that we need to change this number every time.
Finally the long of the password should be big.
We send the attack and we need to look the time of response, one will be notable higher, this one it is the "user".
